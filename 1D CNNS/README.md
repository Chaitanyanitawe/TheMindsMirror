# Week 6 Task

## Tasks
1. **Use 1D CNN model to classify image and non-image data.**

## Pointers
1. You can either combine the entire dataset from Muse, MindWave, and our data or strictly try it on the data we have collected.
2. The task is individual. Collaboration is not allowed, but you can discuss the task among yourselves.
3. At the end of your approach, print the confusion matrix and other essential accuracy parameters.
